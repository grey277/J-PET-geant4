# J-PET Monte Carlo with Geant4 

**JPetMC** is a simulation program written in a **GEANT4** environment.  
Details of the J-PET detector can be found on the project [webpage](http://koza.if.uj.edu.pl/pet/).  
Its main features:  
- the J-PET detector geometry is loaded from the (CAD) technical drawings  
- user can load detector setups (identified by run numbers), which corresponds to
one used in the experiment.  
- the mcGeant.root is created as an output file. It can be processed by the [J-PET Framework](https://github.com/JPETTomography/j-pet-framework-examples) software.
