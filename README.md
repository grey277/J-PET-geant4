# J-PET Monte Carlo with Geant4

## Software information

J-PET-Geant4 is a Monte Carlo simulation program designed for the
[J-PET](http://koza.if.uj.edu.pl/pet/) detector 
written in C++ using Geant4 toolkit and ROOT libraries.
Program output is prepared in a Root tree format and can be directly loaded
into [J-PET Framework](https://github.com/JPETTomography/j-pet-framework-examples) software.

Detector geometry consists of following components: layers of the scintillators, detector frame
and sources. In general, user can modify the source code and incorporate in a easy way any type of
needed geometry. Several user examples are available directly in a form of macros.
